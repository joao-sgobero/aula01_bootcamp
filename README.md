# Lesson 01 - Introduction to Python

In this first lesson of the bootcamp, we learned basic Python concepts such as data input, output printing, and simple operations with variables. We received some challenges to practice these fundamentals.

In the challenges, I initially solved the exercises using only the resources presented in the lesson to consolidate my learning. Later, I decided to optimize and refactor these exercises, while staying faithful to the skills already taught, avoiding more advanced features to deepen the practice of basic concepts.

This process has been essential for exercising my logical thinking and solving real problems.

I am very excited about this introduction to Python. One of the reasons that led me to migrate to this career is my desire to work in scientific research and real-world challenges, especially in the area of health and quality of life.

Soon, I plan to write articles on Medium sharing this journey and my reflections.

Although I am not yet fluent in English, I am dedicating myself a lot, along with other courses in the area. Therefore, I plan to continue translating the upcoming lessons into English, seeking greater standardization. If you find any spelling mistakes, please kindly overlook them.

You are invited to follow my evolution and reasoning throughout this and future lessons.
